# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation that guides users through integrating the Outlook MCP server with their local n8n service. The documentation will enable users to leverage the MCP server's email capabilities within n8n workflows, even when the server has no public domain or static IP address. This integration will allow users to create automated email workflows using n8n's visual workflow builder while accessing Outlook data through the MCP server.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running n8n locally, I want clear setup instructions for connecting to the Outlook MCP server, so that I can access Outlook functionality in my workflows without needing a public domain or static IP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows the setup instructions THEN they SHALL be able to establish a connection between n8n and the MCP server running on localhost
2. WHEN the MCP server has no public domain or static IP THEN the documentation SHALL provide localhost-based connection methods
3. WHEN a user configures the connection THEN the system SHALL validate the connection is working properly
4. IF the connection fails THEN the documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting steps for common issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an n8n workflow creator, I want examples of how to use MCP server functions in workflows, so that I can understand how to integrate email operations into my automation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reviews the documentation THEN they SHALL find practical workflow examples using MCP server email functions
2. WHEN implementing email workflows THEN the examples SHALL demonstrate common use cases like reading emails, sending responses, and processing attachments
3. WHEN following workflow examples THEN users SHALL be able to replicate the functionality in their own n8n instance
4. IF users need to customize workflows THEN the documentation SHALL explain how to modify the examples for different scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want security and configuration guidance for the MCP server integration, so that I can ensure the setup is secure and properly configured for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the documentation SHALL provide security best practices for localhost connections
2. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL support secure credential management between n8n and the MCP server
3. WHEN running in production THEN the documentation SHALL address security considerations for the MCP server
4. IF security issues arise THEN the documentation SHALL provide guidance on securing the integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a technical user, I want detailed API reference information, so that I can understand all available MCP server functions and how to use them in n8n nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API reference THEN users SHALL find complete documentation of all MCP server endpoints and functions
2. WHEN using MCP functions in n8n THEN the documentation SHALL show the exact parameters and expected responses
3. WHEN troubleshooting API calls THEN users SHALL have access to error codes and their meanings
4. IF new MCP functions are added THEN the documentation SHALL be easily updatable to include new capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want step-by-step tutorials for common email automation scenarios, so that I can quickly implement email-based workflows without extensive trial and error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following tutorials THEN users SHALL be able to create functional email workflows from start to finish
2. WHEN implementing common scenarios THEN the tutorials SHALL cover email filtering, automated responses, and data extraction
3. WHEN customizing workflows THEN the tutorials SHALL explain how to adapt examples for specific business needs
4. IF users encounter issues THEN each tutorial SHALL include troubleshooting sections for common problems
