# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a Managed Control Protocol (MCP) server that interfaces with an open Microsoft Outlook application using Python third-party libraries. The server will implement the complete MCP protocol and provide four core email-related functions: listing emails, retrieving specific emails, searching emails, and listing folders. The server must be lightweight, responsive, and provide structured JSON responses for easy integration with other systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Outlook, I want to list emails from specified folders with filtering options, so that I can retrieve relevant emails efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls list_emails with a folder parameter THEN the system SHALL return emails from that specific folder
2. WHEN a user calls list_emails with an 'unread' filter THEN the system SHALL return only unread emails
3. WHEN a user calls list_emails with a limit parameter THEN the system SHALL return no more than the specified number of emails
4. WHEN a user calls list_emails with an invalid folder THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN list_emails is called THEN the system SHALL return results in structured JSON format
6. WHEN list_emails is called THEN the system SHALL include essential email metadata (sender, subject, timestamp, read status)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve detailed information for a specific email by its unique ID, so that I can access complete email content when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls get_email with a valid email ID THEN the system SHALL return complete email details
2. WHEN get_email is called THEN the system SHALL include sender, subject, body, timestamp, and other key metadata
3. WHEN a user calls get_email with an invalid email ID THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN get_email returns data THEN the system SHALL format the response as structured JSON
5. WHEN get_email processes HTML emails THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting information appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search emails based on user-defined queries, so that I can find specific emails across folders efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls search_emails with a query parameter THEN the system SHALL perform a search operation on email content
2. WHEN search_emails is called with a folder parameter THEN the system SHALL limit search to that specific folder
3. WHEN search_emails is called with a limit parameter THEN the system SHALL return no more than the specified number of results
4. WHEN search_emails is called without a folder parameter THEN the system SHALL search across all accessible folders
5. WHEN search_emails returns results THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear, user-friendly JSON format
6. WHEN search_emails finds no matches THEN the system SHALL return an empty results array with appropriate status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to list all available email folders in Outlook, so that I can identify valid folder targets for other operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls get_folders THEN the system SHALL return all available email folders
2. WHEN get_folders returns data THEN the system SHALL include folder names and their respective identifiers
3. WHEN get_folders is called THEN the system SHALL return results in structured JSON format
4. WHEN Outlook has nested folders THEN the system SHALL represent the folder hierarchy appropriately
5. WHEN get_folders encounters access restrictions THEN the system SHALL handle permissions gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor server performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any function encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL log all significant activities and errors for debugging purposes
3. WHEN Outlook is not available or accessible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return descriptive error messages
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify Outlook connectivity and log the connection status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to implement the complete MCP protocol, so that it can integrate seamlessly with MCP-compatible clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL implement all required MCP protocol endpoints
2. WHEN clients connect THEN the system SHALL handle MCP handshake and capability negotiation
3. WHEN MCP requests are received THEN the system SHALL process them according to MCP specification
4. WHEN the server responds THEN it SHALL format all responses according to MCP protocol standards
5. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to be lightweight and responsive, so that it can handle multiple requests efficiently without impacting system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without blocking
2. WHEN the server operates THEN it SHALL maintain minimal memory footprint
3. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL respond within reasonable time limits
4. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL consume minimal system resources
5. WHEN handling large email datasets THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate pagination and limits

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand and implement the server functions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear descriptions of all function parameters
2. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include expected output formats for each function
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include practical example use cases
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages that aid in troubleshooting
5. WHEN the server is deployed THEN it SHALL include setup and configuration instructions
